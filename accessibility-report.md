Priniples of Universal Design:

1. Equitable Use - The program allows for users who are visual learners and have trouble keeping track of many events at once, to be able to visualize their wikipedia traversal by navigating to the ‘graph’ view. Our program also has an autocomplete/typo-correction for when the user intiates their journey in the 'search' view, making it easier for those with dyslexia or lower levels of English to use the program.

2. Flexibility in Use - Doesn't apply to our program because there is not much room for preference to impact the funtionality of our program, except for some UI settings (i.e. dark mode) we could have implemented (time permitting)

3. Simple and Intuitive Use - The design of our program is intuitive, with the navbar making it easy and unambiguous regarding where the User should click to save their journey, open a previous journey, start a new journey or view the graph This feature significantly reduces the cognitive load on the user, allowing for a lower concentration level and knowledge for use.

4. Perceptible Information - Many of our buttons are responsive and will produce a pop-up message if what the user is doing is invalid. For example, if the user clicks on the nav-bar button for opening the ‘save’ page and does not have a journey open, a pop-up will appear to explain that the User needs to have a journey open in order to save it. Another example is regarding the save view, where when the User tries to save a journey with the same name or the same sequence of nodes, a label will change to corresponding error message (i.e. ‘You already have a journey by that name’)

5. Tolerance for Error - If the user accidentally closes the current journey, they can simply navigate to the open view where they will find an ‘Open Last’ button. This ensures that the user does not have to look through all of the saved journeys to find the last one they accidentally closed.
6. Low Physical Effort - Does not apply, as our program is a computer program and is low physical effort by default.
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use - The default size for our program takes up the entire monitor for a resolution of 1920 x 1080, which allows the user to easily view any element of our program with low effort. Additionally, the user may resize the window to virtually any size that their monitor permits, perhaps to use our program in tandem with other apps or windows.

Which audience(s) would we market our program to?

We would market our program to anyone aged 12-70 in any nation which is either anglophone or has a significant proportion of the population who are English speakers. This is mainly due to two reasons - the age bracket corresponds to those most familiar with Wikipedia and were most likely active on the internet when Wikipedia was released or popular. The English part corresponds to the fact that the mediaWiki API we used to retrieve webpage information was specifically making calls for Wikipedia English webpages (thus translation is not supported by our program, although that would be another interesting accessibility feature, time permitting).

Is our program less likely to be used by certain demographics?

Yes, our program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, those who are too young to have had much experience using the internet (age < 12) or those too old to have a substantially intuitive sense of using the internet comfortably (age > 70). Although, note that these are only soft guidelines and does not generalize to every individual in a given age bracket. Another demographic that would be less likely to use our program are those who are not proficient in English. As previously mentioned, our program’s API calls involved receiving webpage data in the form of Wikipedia English articles, specifically.
